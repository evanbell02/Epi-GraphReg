# EpiGraphReg

### Environment Setup
The conda environment needed to run all scripts in this repository can be created using `conda env create -f environment.yml`.

### Preparing Data
Sythetic data may be generated by running `scripts/make_data.py`. The data generated by this script is also already available in the `data` folder.

### Training and testing models 
All model training and testing occurs using the PyTorch Lighntning command line interface (CLI), and all training settings can easily be configured using `.yml` config files or command line arguments. For example, to train the Epi-GraphReg model, one would run `python scripts/train_epi_graph_reg.py fit -c configs/train_settings.yml`. Testing can also be performed with the Lightning CLI by specifying a checkpoint path.
